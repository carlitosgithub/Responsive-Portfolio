      <p>My Passion for Computers can be tracked back to my high-school days. Whether as a member of my high school computer’s club or just helping my classmates with computer issues. The reason? I like getting people excited about technology advances! That’s why I choose my career as an IT Desktop Support and now taking coding classes.</p>

      <p>Outside of the office, I’m always learning about new technology’s and the best way to implement it on daily basis. I’m fluent in Spanish and always looking to learn more languages that I can use while a travel around the world (this is my hobby). Connect with me over LinkedIn for networking and more!</p>
